This project was my first ever iOS application. To this day is it one of my proudest accomplishments.
Planning, coding, iterating and most importantly learning was all done _by myself_.
This application was a result of a startup I was involved with in an incubator. 
After we became [a statistic](http://www.forbes.com/sites/neilpatel/2015/01/16/90-of-startups-will-fail-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-10/#3fc13cbd55e1), I decided to share the code.

Enjoy poking around the little primitive world I made for myself in the summer of 2014.

Frameworks removed before push: Parse, Bots, Google, Facebook.
